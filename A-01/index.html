<h2><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome">About Rome</a></h2>
<br>
<br>

<p>
Roma, Latin: Rōma, nicknamed The Eternal City, La Città Eterna) is a city and special municipality (named Comune di Roma Capitale) in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), it is also the country's largest and most populated comune and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents.The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. 
<br>
<br>
Rome's history spans more than two and a half thousand years. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at only around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe. The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded as one of the birthplaces of Western civilisation and by some as the first ever metropolis. It was first called urbs aeterna (The Eternal City) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BCE, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. Rome is also called the "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World).</p>

<h2>Places You Should Not Miss</h2>

<h2>Campidoglio (The Capitoline Hill)</h2>

  <div class="newspaper">
 While being the lowest and smallest of the seven hills of Rome (The Aventino, Capitoline, Caeline, Esquiline, Palatine, Quirinale, Viminale), the Capitoline is perhaps the most closely bound to the city’s history, as it has been the hub of Rome’s political and religious life since ancient times.
<br>
  Today the Michaelangelo piazza, reached by climbing a splendid  flight of steps, is encircled by two identical buildings (Palazzo dei Conservatori and Palazzo Nuovo, home to the Capitoline Museum) and Palazzo Senatorio, which serves as the seat of the Mayor of Rome.

<h2>The Colosseum</h2>

  <div class="newspaper"> The construction of the largest amphitheater of the Roman Empire was started by Vespasian in 72 AD. This building was planned to change the relationship between power and people from then on: entertainment and distraction offered to the populace for free.
<br>
  <br>
  The Colosseum was used for gladiator fights and hunting simulations involving ferocious and exotic animals. The capacity is estimated around 70.000 people; the shows became occasions to impress and control the people through an unforeseen display of astonishing special effects. Today it is possible to visit and understand how the underground theatrical system worked, with hoists, ramps and trapdoors, in order to present the animals, gladiators and scenery machineries to an overwhelmed crowd. Find out the unbelievable engineering techniques that allowed ancient Romans to complete this massive structure, that has reached us today, in less than 10 years.
  <br>

  It may be two thousand years old but the Colosseum is still the symbol of the eternal city, every year drawing thousands of visitors, meaning long queues and an endless wait.In order to avoid the problem, a ticket may be purchased in advance visiting the website www.coopculture.it or alternatively by buying one of two tourist cards: the “Roma Pass” which entitles holders to free admission and no-queue entrance for the first two museums and to free travel throughout Rome, or the “Archeologia Card” which is valid for 7 days and allows free entry into each of the following sites:  Palazzo Massimo, Palazzo Altemps, Crypta Balbi, Terme di Diocleziano (Baths of Diocletian), the Colosseum, the Palatine, Terme di Caracalla (Caracalla Baths), Villa dei Quintili, Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella. TO BE SEEN: The Palatine, Roman Forum, Domus Aurea, Arch of Constatine, House of Augustus, House of Livia. </div>

<h2>The Pantheon</h2>

  <p>Lift up your head on entering. Our attention is caught straightaway by a ray of slanting sunlight shooting down from the “oculus”,  a 9- metre round aperture at the very top of the dome that illuminates the entire building. If it is raining, watch the falling water disappear into the floor’s 22 virtually invisible holes.
 
  Dedicated to the worship of every god (Pan-every Theon-divinity), the Pantheon was built by the Emperor Hadrian between 118 and 125 A.D. over the ruins of another temple dating back to 27 A.D.  Statesman and General Marcus Agrippa was responsible for the construction of the original church, to whom a dedicatory inscription is clearly visible over today’s magnificent portico.

  In 609, it was converted into a Christian Church by Pope Boniface IV and consecrated to Santa Maria of the Martyrs.Turned into a memorial chapel for the kingsof Italy in 1870, the tombs of Vittorio Emanuele II, Umberto I and Margherita of Savoy are to be found here together with that of the celebrated Renaissance Artist Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino, who is more often referred to as simply Raphael.</p>

<h2>The Trevi Fountain</h2>

<p>Work on the celebrated rococo fountain was first begun in 1732 by Nicola Salvi (who beat off competition to be awarded the commission by Pope Clement XII) 
and was completed by Giuseppe 
Pannini in 1762.

The monument, whose water is supplied 
by one of the oldest Roman aqueducts, the “Acqua Virgine”, has been sculptured against the backdrop of Palazzo Poli and depicts Triton taming Oceanus’ shell-shaped chariot drawn by sea horses.

Before moving off, do not forget to throw a coin in the fountain. Custom has it that travellers doing this will one day return to the eternal city. Those seeking a little romance, perhaps even an Italian love, should then toss a second, third coin to make sure wedding bells will soon be chiming.

Not forgetting of course that the fountain provided the splendid setting for the best-known scene from director Federico Fellini’s classic film “La Dolce Vita”: a provocative Anita Ekberg swathed in a long black evening dress calls out for Marcello Mastroianni, “Marcello, Come Here!” as she glides through the fountain’s sparkling waters.

Restoration of the Trevi Fountain started on July 2014. After 17-month restoration, the fountain has now a new lighting.Official inauguration, Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2015.</p>
